In the procedural programming course for the 2022/2023 academic year, students will be assigned a practicum assignment. Procedural programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating procedures or routines that perform specific tasks within a program. It emphasizes the use of procedures, functions, and blocks of code to structure and organize a program's logic.
The practicum assignment is designed to provide hands-on experience and reinforce the concepts taught in the course. It typically involves writing programs using procedural programming principles and techniques. Students may be given a problem statement or a set of requirements that they need to implement using procedural C programming languages.
